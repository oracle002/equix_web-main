    `Equix Solutions began as a small, curious collective of designers,
     developers, and digital dreamers—united by a shared passion for
     technology, creativity, and problem-solving. What started as
     late-night coding sessions and ambitious side projects soon
     evolved into something much bigger: a vision to reshape how
     businesses interact with technology.`,
    `Over the years, we’ve grown—organically and intentionally—into a
     multidisciplinary powerhouse of strategists, engineers, UI/UX
     designers, branding experts, and solution architects. Our team
     doesn’t just build tech; we craft experiences. We don’t just solve
     problems; we anticipate them.`,
  ],
  bottomText: `We’ve stayed close to our roots—nimble, creative, and
  people-first—while expanding our reach across industries, platforms,
  and continents. Whether it’s building a high-performance mobile app,
  modernizing enterprise systems, or designing intuitive interfaces,
  every solution we craft begins with curiosity and ends in impact.
  At Equix, we don’t just keep up with change—we help lead it.`,
